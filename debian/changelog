  * Add --interactive-debug startup switch.  This turns on GtkInspector, restricts the screensaver stage to a single monitor, and some other things to allow interaction with ui elements using the inspector tools.

  * framedImage.py:  Just silently fail if a downloaded image fails to be loaded into a pixbuf.
  * some theme fixes for gtk 3.20+
  * stage.py: clear clipboards only once, when waking.  raise_unlock_widget gets called repeatedly when there is input (to refresh other things) - having it repeatedly clear the clipboard was unnecessary, and prevented keyboard navigation actions that included selection of characters - such as ctrl-a, shift-home and -end.
  * uPowerClient.py: aggregate the proxy's signal emissions into a single power-state-changed event for the power client.  This prevents confusion at the stage level when updating for power events.
  * notifications: Add some debugging help.
  * notificationWidget.py: ignore network notifications - these occur often around suspend/resume time, and we don't want them artificially padding the notification count.
  * xscreensaver plugin: Use GSubprocess instead of g_spawn_async for hacks.
  * stage.py:  Add some error-handling for widget creation, with exit strategy, in case something goes wrong.  We don't want to leave the user with an inaccessible desktop.

  * Enable notification watcher's debug code upon startup, rather than during widget construction.
  * Respect the "spanned" setting for wallpapers.  Note, this will currently also affect the plugins as well, but I didn't see this as a serious drawback.

  * Remove x11.py, move code to CsScreen class, remove python3-xlib dependency.
  * service.py: Wait to respond to the Lock command until the screensaver has called back that it is now active.
  * manager/stage: Lock immediately, without fade-in.  This and the previous commit allow the screensaver to be activated synchronously from cinnamon-session in response to suspend/hibernate actions, and ensure it's fully active already when resuming.
  * cinnamon-screensaver-main.py: don't import the ScreensaverService until we're sure we'll need it.  This prevents singletons from getting initialized too early, and we lose the correct state of status.Debug
  * cs-notification-watcher.c: transient hint should be a boolean type, not int.
  * service.py: Add the invocation to the queue prior to calling on the manager to lock.  The active signal could be sent back before it gets added otherwise, causing us to leave the calling command hanging.
  * stage/fader: Realize the stage offscreen, then reposition it before starting our fade in.  This prevents the initial flash sometimes seen when the idle fade kicks in.
  * cs-screen-x11.c: Use PointerRoot instead of None for XSetInputFocus. This does a better job of reacquiring keyboard control, and allows the screensaver to activate when a virtualbox guest window is focused.
  * stage/fader: Add the reposition call to the fader cycle, this ensures it gets reliably called in sync with redraws, otherwise we can still get a flash on realizing the window.
  * cs-auth-pam.c: Only attempt to remove the io watch if thread_done is FALSE.  It is set to TRUE in the GIOFunc cs_auth_loop_quit, which also returns FALSE, signalling to remove the source.  We can't zero out watch_id there, which was causing a warning when cs_auth_pam_verify_user exited.
  * volumeControl.py: Don't show if we can't get a valid CvcMixerControl, and only connect signals if we do.
  * mediaPlayerWatcher.py: use the async versions of the play/pause, previous and next methods.  This prevents a dbus sync deadlock from freezing the screensaver.  Observed issue using Google Play Desktop Music Player.  (https://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com)
  * passwordEntry.py: Initialize self.original_group, don't perform draw callback without a live controller (this disparity can occur after session interruptions - sleep, switch user, etc... - but not consistently.)
  * passwordEntry.py: Reload the keyboard layout if the xkb configuration changes.
  * stage.py: fix screen changed callback

  * manager.py: Fix pam helper cancellation in LMDE - we have an existing workaround for LMDE that skips the fade-out when unlocking, due to another issue.  This causes our despawn_stage callback to be called immediately, which sets self.stage to None, before cancel_unlocking can be run.
  * keybindings.py: Don't allow the keyboard popup menu key to slip thru.

  * cinnamon-screensaver-main.py: use setproctitle to set the process name as "cinnamon-screensaver"
  * configure.ac: Fix regression from git conflict - originally from aad72c98f1df63
  * Add a build option to enable/disable use of setresuid/setresgid in the setuid.c file for some distributions.  The default behavior remains to *not* use this.
  * Override the background color to transparent for various 'primary' widgets, this reduces (but does not eliminate) the tendency to get a 'flash' when the screensaver spawns its window.
  * mediaPlayerWatcher.py: handle metadata more gracefully - some players can return arrays of artist info, some a string - handle either.

  * events: For gtk < 3.18, skip the fade out animation, and immediately destroy the window.  Move the deactivate command into an idle callback, so we're not attempting to destroy the window while in the middle of processing a motion event.
  * passwordEntry.py: emulate Gtk.Entry.grab_focus_without_selecting() - the real call was recently removed, as it doesn't exist in Gtk 3.14, however the behavior is still necessary - tabbing between buttons and entry will cause the entire partial password to be selected, causing overwrite.  This restores the original functionality without requiring gtk 3.18+
  * Fixes for Betsy/Jessie:
  * panels: Remove separators.  Tweak spacing for keyboard layout icon in the gtk 3.18 css file.
  * utils.py: clean up get_user_name() calls.

  * Theme work - ensure everything is reasonably able to be themed, and provide fallback styling if the currently selected theme doesn't supply anything - this is done by searching for the toplevel style class - "csstage" corresponding to the toplevel window for the screensaver.
  * Add separate theming for Gtk 3.20+, update .gitignore, load a css file appropriate to the current Gtk version at startup (if no theme support is found).  Fix error handling in mediaPlayerWatcher.py.

  * Stage: Listen for GdkScreen changes in size and number of monitors, and reconstruct the monitorViews as needed.
  * stage.py: Fix oversized info panel.
  * Add script for testing keyboard layouts.
  * Use XAppKbdLayoutController to interact with libgnomekbd for switching keyboard layouts and getting reliable flag icons.
  * unlock.py: Split out PasswordEntry and FramedImage to their own files.
  * Fix keyboard layout representation in the password entry.  GtkEntry is hardcoded to produce a menu-sized icon.  We supply a blank icon, and draw our own where it belongs, and at a better size.  This way, we can also provide themed text layout names as well, depending on user preference.
  * Add albumart widget.
  * finish implementing albumart preference.
  * stage: Don't let floating widgets overlap, catch a couple potential errors when loading pixbufs - namely when we interrupt it by skipping a track.
  * pyflakes cleanup
  * libcscreensaver: Fix new build warnings, fix shape extension detection for the event filter.
  * passwordEntry.py: Don't connect to draw and icon press signals if the keyboard layout controller is disabled.
  * Remove unused file.
  * proxies: Strip out unused interface elements to reduce lib size and runtime memory use (slightly.)
  * passwordEntry.py: Rework to stay in sync with XApp.KbdLayoutController changes.  Perform all rendering/loading of icons ourselves, depend on new icon package, use new cinnamon desktop preferences for flag/case settings.
  * Add preferences to lock down media keys, media player controls, notification counter.
