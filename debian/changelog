  * cs-screen-x11.c: gdk_flush before retrieving updated monitor and screen information.  This is done in stage.py when responding to our CsScreen's signals, but we should do it here before rebuilding the monitor info for sharing with the stage.
  * monitorView.py: Improve plugin behavior, logging, during screensaver activation/deactivation.

  * xscreensavers: Add safechild wrapper (from blueberry) - provides better control over screensaver hack processes, to prevent their lingering after the screensaver or cinnamon-settings is done with them.
  * xscreensavers: Use python3 for safechild, attempt to kill the hack process when terminated.
  * service, manager: always complete the lock invocation, whether we succeed or not, and whether we were already active or not.

  * cs-screen-x11.c: GdkScreen width and height arrive already scaled for hidpi.
  * logind/consolekit: Refresh screen and monitor info when coming back from inactive (such as sleep.)

cinnamon-screensaver (3.4.1) sonya; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * stage.py: Kill any screensaver plugins when destroying all of the widgets - this will leave unfinished plugin processes.
  * framedImage: render images at their native size using the theme value as the maximum size, rather than desired size.  This ensures the image displays at its best possible size for quality, but still makes sure an oversize image doesn't break anything.
  * stage.py: Don't re-allocate the floating widgets unless necessary to prevent obscuring of the unlock widget.  This prevents the small jump of the clock when waking the computer, depending on settings.
  * framedImage: Remove some dead lines, use the correct css property, update commenting.
  * fix typo in 3.20 css file
  * clock: Update to use new wall-clock api to set the correct update interval depending on the provided date/time format.

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * Don't lock the screen in live or guest sessions

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * framedImage.py: Stop using CSS for image size - since we now use the image's native size if it is reasonable to do so, there's no need for a theme to be involved.  Just hardcode a sane maximum and keep images that size or less. is not valid CSS (even though that's what we're using min-height for here)

  [ leigh123linux ]
  * add libexec path

  [ Clement Lefebvre ]
  * l10n: Update POT file

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * Add --interactive-debug startup switch.  This turns on GtkInspector, restricts the screensaver stage to a single monitor, and some other things to allow interaction with ui elements using the inspector tools.
  * mediaPlayerWatcher.py: catch SyntaxError exception when evaluating PlaybackStatus property.
  * framedImage.py:  Just silently fail if a downloaded image fails to be loaded into a pixbuf.
  * some theme fixes for gtk 3.20+
  * stage.py: clear clipboards only once, when waking.  raise_unlock_widget gets called repeatedly when there is input (to refresh other things) - having it repeatedly clear the clipboard was unnecessary, and prevented keyboard navigation actions that included selection of characters - such as ctrl-a, shift-home and -end.
  * uPowerClient.py: aggregate the proxy's signal emissions into a single power-state-changed event for the power client.  This prevents confusion at the stage level when updating for power events.
  * notifications: Add some debugging help.
  * notificationWidget.py: ignore network notifications - these occur often around suspend/resume time, and we don't want them artificially padding the notification count.
  * xscreensaver plugin: Use GSubprocess instead of g_spawn_async for hacks.
  * stage.py:  Add some error-handling for widget creation, with exit strategy, in case something goes wrong.  We don't want to leave the user with an inaccessible desktop.
  * xscreensaver plugin: provide a default .xscreensaver file if one doesn't already exist.

  [ Sparky Bluefang ]
  * Add /usr/lib/misc/xscreensaver/ to the xscreensaver search directories.

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * stage.py: More error-handling fixes.  Add a debug package to the debian build.
  * authClient.py: Add some debugging info.
  * Add a CsScreen object:  GdkScreen is unreliable for figuring out monitor sizes and resolutions, particularly in non-default configurations.
  * Enable notification watcher's debug code upon startup, rather than during widget construction.
  * Respect the "spanned" setting for wallpapers.  Note, this will currently also affect the plugins as well, but I didn't see this as a serious drawback.
  * cs-screen-x11.c: Account for monitor scale factor.  GTK expects the values to be scaled already.
  * cs-screen-x11.c: code cleanup (sorry git!)
  * singletons.py: Add some debugging for login manager commands.
  * Remove x11.py, move code to CsScreen class, remove python3-xlib dependency.
  * service.py: Wait to respond to the Lock command until the screensaver has called back that it is now active.
  * manager/stage: Lock immediately, without fade-in.  This and the previous commit allow the screensaver to be activated synchronously from cinnamon-session in response to suspend/hibernate actions, and ensure it's fully active already when resuming.
  * cinnamon-screensaver-main.py: don't import the ScreensaverService until we're sure we'll need it.  This prevents singletons from getting initialized too early, and we lose the correct state of status.Debug
  * cs-notification-watcher.c: transient hint should be a boolean type, not int.
  * service.py: Add the invocation to the queue prior to calling on the manager to lock.  The active signal could be sent back before it gets added otherwise, causing us to leave the calling command hanging.
  * stage/fader: Realize the stage offscreen, then reposition it before starting our fade in.  This prevents the initial flash sometimes seen when the idle fade kicks in.
  * cs-screen-x11.c: Use PointerRoot instead of None for XSetInputFocus. This does a better job of reacquiring keyboard control, and allows the screensaver to activate when a virtualbox guest window is focused.
  * stage/fader: Add the reposition call to the fader cycle, this ensures it gets reliably called in sync with redraws, otherwise we can still get a flash on realizing the window.
  * cs-auth-pam.c: Only attempt to remove the io watch if thread_done is FALSE.  It is set to TRUE in the GIOFunc cs_auth_loop_quit, which also returns FALSE, signalling to remove the source.  We can't zero out watch_id there, which was causing a warning when cs_auth_pam_verify_user exited.
  * volumeControl.py: Don't show if we can't get a valid CvcMixerControl, and only connect signals if we do.
  * mediaPlayerWatcher.py: use the async versions of the play/pause, previous and next methods.  This prevents a dbus sync deadlock from freezing the screensaver.  Observed issue using Google Play Desktop Music Player.  (https://www.googleplaymusicdesktopplayer.com)
  * passwordEntry.py: Initialize self.original_group, don't perform draw callback without a live controller (this disparity can occur after session interruptions - sleep, switch user, etc... - but not consistently.)
  * passwordEntry.py: Reload the keyboard layout if the xkb configuration changes.
  * stage.py: fix screen changed callback

  [ leigh123linux ]
  * autogen.sh: don't run aclocal

  * add libexec path

  [ Michael Webster ]
  * manager.py: Fix pam helper cancellation in LMDE - we have an existing workaround for LMDE that skips the fade-out when unlocking, due to another issue.  This causes our despawn_stage callback to be called immediately, which sets self.stage to None, before cancel_unlocking can be run.
  * keybindings.py: Don't allow the keyboard popup menu key to slip thru.
  * stage: Clear the clipboard if we're locked (should be inaccessible anyhow but...)
  * Add some tooltips to a few ui elements.
  * stage.py: Fix logic surrounding hiding/showing the floating widgets when power states change, or when a plugin is unable to run due to the power state.

  * clock.py: Make clock preference apply everywhere (like our other prefs)
  * cinnamon-screensaver-main.py: use setproctitle to set the process name as "cinnamon-screensaver"
  * configure.ac: Fix regression from git conflict - originally from aad72c98f1df63
  * Add a build option to enable/disable use of setresuid/setresgid in the setuid.c file for some distributions.  The default behavior remains to *not* use this.
  * Override the background color to transparent for various 'primary' widgets, this reduces (but does not eliminate) the tendency to get a 'flash' when the screensaver spawns its window.

  * passwordEntry.py: emulate Gtk.Entry.grab_focus_without_selecting() - the real call was recently removed, as it doesn't exist in Gtk 3.14, however the behavior is still necessary - tabbing between buttons and entry will cause the entire partial password to be selected, causing overwrite.

  * Fix keyboard layout representation in the password entry.  GtkEntry is hardcoded to produce a menu-sized icon.  We supply a blank icon, and draw our own where it belongs, and at a better size.  This way, we can also provide themed text layout names as well, depending on user preference.
  * Add albumart widget.
  * finish implementing albumart preference.
  * stage: Don't let floating widgets overlap, catch a couple potential errors when loading pixbufs - namely when we interrupt it by skipping a track.
  * pyflakes cleanup
  * libcscreensaver: Fix new build warnings, fix shape extension detection for the event filter.
  * passwordEntry.py: Don't connect to draw and icon press signals if the keyboard layout controller is disabled.
  * Remove unused file.
  * proxies: Strip out unused interface elements to reduce lib size and runtime memory use (slightly.)
  * passwordEntry.py: Rework to stay in sync with XApp.KbdLayoutController changes.  Perform all rendering/loading of icons ourselves, depend on new icon package, use new cinnamon desktop preferences for flag/case settings.
  * Add preferences to lock down media keys, media player controls, notification counter.
