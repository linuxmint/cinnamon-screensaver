HACKING
=======

Cinnamon-Screensaver is normally build using dpkg. If using Linux Mint, Ubuntu,
or any other member of the Debian family, install the `devscripts` package with
 `sudo apt-get install devscripts`.
 
Once you have devscripts, run `debuild -us -uc` to build cinnamon-screensaver
(or any other cinnamon package) and `sudo dpkg -i ../cinnamon-screensaver_{version}_{arch}.deb`
to install.
